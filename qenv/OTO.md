No problem, I just need to find a solution
Specifically with respect to the article, the open loss is incurred as the difference 
between the current mark price and the limit price of the orders
the mark price changes and surely as such the open loss should change
if one were to open a given buy order when there were already 4 unfavorably placed buy orders, 
one would need to know the sum of the open loss of the other orders at that instant
This article is also insufficient. i.e. the available margin isn't only affected by initial
margin requirements of the open orders, it is also affected by the sum of the loss of 
the unfavorably placed orders. How does one calculate this loss?

AMD CEO Lisa Su ‚Äì the CEO of multinational company Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD).

Disney / The Mouse ‚Äì similar to AMD, Disney, often referred to as "the mouse," is a popular stock in /r/wallstreetbets, both as a meme and a trading choice.

1. Ankle biter: This phrase ‚Äî used outside the world of finance to describe small children who are so little that they, metaphorically at least, barely reach an adult's ankles ‚Äî can also be used to describe a small cap investment. Small cap just means a company with a relatively low value, or market capitalization ‚Äî usually somewhere between $300 million and $2 billion.

2. Big uglies: Big, older companies, usually in "dirty" industrial sectors like mining or steel. Though they can be solid investments with good, steady returns, many investors ignore them for "cleaner," trendier stocks.

3. Chasing nickels around dollar bills: The practice of big companies trimming small, trivial costs (like candy in the lobby) instead of big, serious costs (like the entire research department).

4. Cockroach theory: The theory that when a company reports bad news to the public, there's usually a lot more bad news behind the scenes that may come out later. It can also refer to industry-wide suspicions ‚Äî if one subprime lender is going bankrupt (like New Century Financial was in 2007), other subprime lenders might have similar problems behind the scenes.

5. Cookie jar accounting: An accounting practice in which a company stores up funds during good times to dip into during bad times. Because it effectively misleads investors ‚Äî making them think goals are being met even when the company is losing footing ‚Äî this practice is forbidden by the SEC.

6. Dead cat bounce: A small rally after a sharp decline on Wall Street. It could refer to a stock with a plummeting share price or a market trend. An old investment saying goes: "Even a dead cat will bounce if it is dropped from high enough."

7. Garbatrage: When price and trading volume in a particular sector surge due to a high-profile takeover in that industry. Speculators often predict that more takeovers are right around the corner, even if they actually aren't. Also known as "rumortrage."

8. Jennifer Lopez: An informal term that describes what happens when a security reaches a low, then gradually starts to go up again. On a graph, it looks like a curve at the bottom, which is why investors named it after the admirably round-bottomed singer. 

9. Puke point: Puking, in this case, is slang for selling an asset as the value is plummeting. The "puke point" is the point at which the investor can no longer stomach the losses, and decides to sell the asset, regardless of its steeply falling price.

10. Razorblade model: When businesses sell dependent goods for different prices. The first part is sold cheaply, but the second part is much pricier. It's not unlike razors with replaceable blades. Often the razor is pretty cheap, but customers have to keep replacing the blade cartridges, and that cost adds up.

11. Rust Bowl: A bummer phrase used to describe northeast and midwestern areas where the auto and steel industries used to thrive, and now either languish, or quasi-thrive thanks to federal help. As Investopedia puts it: "The term 'Rust Bowl' essentially epitomizes catastrophic economic change."

12. Sandwich generation: It sounds like a fun term, but the sandwich generation actually refers to the age group sandwiched between their aging parents and young kids. These adults are typically tasked with financially supporting both their older and younger dependents while trying to save for their own retirements. The sandwich gen may eat actual sandwiches, but probably only as a way to save money (or to stress-binge).

13. Shark watcher: A firm that specializes in keeping a lookout for takeovers. Usually this means monitoring trading, keeping track of who's accumulating shares, and reporting noteworthy activity back to clients.

14. Sleeping beauty: A profitable company ‚Äî usually a start-up ‚Äî with impressive assets but bad management. These companies are great candidates for takeovers.

15. Suicide pill: Any takeover prevention tactic that can end in the death of a company. Taking on extensive debt is one kind of suicide pill. So is offering shares at a discounted price to devalue the company. A company takes a suicide pill when it would prefer to go bankrupt than undergo a hostile takeover.

16. Sushi bond: A bond issued by a Japanese issuer in a non-yen currency. As Investopedia notes, "sushi bonds are especially popular with Japanese institutional investors, since these bonds do not count toward regulatory limits on foreign securities holdings."

17. Tip from a dip: Financial advice from someone who claims to have inside information that could impact stock price. Tips from dips are illegal (obviously).

Flight to quality: When investors flee risky investments such as equities for less risky assets such as cash and treasuries during times of economic crisis or uncertainty.

4. "A piker."
A piker is somebody who pretends to know everything about the Street but doesn't actually know anything and makes very little money working for bottom tier firm.

This term comes from the late 19th century slang verb "pike" meaning "withdraw from an agreement because of overcautiousness."


5. "Big swinging d----"
If you don't know this term, you haven't been anywhere near anyone on Wall Street. The BSD is the person that does the biggest deals, bring in the most money, and is generally a badass everyone looks up to.

The term was referenced in Michael Lewis's "Liar's Poker": "If he could make millions of dollars come out of those phones, he became that most revered of all species: a Big Swinging D*ck."

6. "Hunting elephants"
Most famously said by Warren Buffett, this means that you're looking for big deals. Here's how he put it after announcing that he would do a deal to acquire Heinz with private equity firm 3G.

"I'm ready for another elephant. Please, if you see any walking by, just call me," he told CNBC. "We're prepared. Our elephant gun has been reloaded, and my trigger finger is itchy."

8. "F-You money"
The money it would take for you to leave your job and never work again.

When a sellside analyst upgrades or downgrades a stock for a stupid reason.

Trader: "You see that Guggenheim analysts' Twitter clowngrade? You can't monetize that s--- yet!"

11. "Building a book"
Traditionally and professionally this means that you're building business, a portfolio of trades or deals.

In slang, it means collecting drug deal orders from friends to call them in.

12. "Put it on the tape"
Back in the old days, trade orders to be executed by brokers came out on ticker tape ‚Äî a long roll of paper constantly printing orders and emptying them out to the trading floor. Now all of this is done by computers, of course.

However, the phrase has stuck. Now the tape isn't just for stocks or bonds though, it could be for ordering anything from food to drugs.

13. "Stopped out"
Meaning you're filled on an order and can take no more requests for anything from food to drugs.

15. "Fish"
Girls or clients, either way there are a lot of them in the sea.

16. "Not held"
In trading terms, this means you're free to go to the market. Conversationally, it means "feel free."

Banker 1: "Should we order the $300 bottle of Barolo?"

Banker 2: "It's not held, so whatever."

17. "Uptick"
An upgrade.

Say you're partying at PH-D at the Dream Downtown and your Managing Director decides to buy a bunch of bottles of Grey Goose. That is an uptick.

18. "Traded ahead"
You beat someone to the punch. It's a technical term, yes, but if a Banker 1 is eyeing a girl at the bar and Banker 2 goes and talks to her first...

The next day at the office, Banker 2 to Banker 1: "Sorry bro, traded ahead."

19. "The staffer's coming."
This would usually be salted with expletives, and followed by junior bankers scurrying. The staffer is the usually the very unhappy VP who has to give assignments to analysts and associates, often at night or on the weekends.

20. ‚ÄúWhat is your schedule this weekend?"
In most work environments, this could be a friendly question or perhaps a segue into a negotiation about working a bit on Sunday. On Wall Street, from the staffer, it means whatever plans you had are canceled.

21. "Can you give me some more color on that?
This is a request for additional details, something that you'll hear analysts ask on earnings calls. In conversation, it'd more likely be asking for details about a night out. 

22. "I'm doing market research."
Looking at YouTube.

Forecasting (n.)
The attempt to predict the unknowable by measuring the irrelevant; a task that, in one way or another, employs most people on Wall Street.

A professor who studies the real world from a perch in the ivory tower and concludes that the chaotic interactions of people, goods, and money conform to his or her theories. 


Proprietary algorithms (n.)
Mathematical formulas ostensibly used to manage money that instead etherize the minds of prospective and current clients. The formulas often resemble something like this:

[([e*R2]/‚àëi=n0)2] * P/b = e(R)

When such algorithms are algebraically reduced, they result in the simpler equation:

A * f = p

where A represents the assets of the firm's clients, f equals the fees they pay, and p is the gross profitability of the money management firm (although not its clients.) The other terms in the original algorithms are extraneous, although attempting to solve them does give the firm's employees something to do all day while they watch the fees piling up.
